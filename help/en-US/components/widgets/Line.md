# PROPERTIES

## Points

List of points given as: `x1,y1 x2, y2 x3, y3 ...`, for example: `0,0 50,50 100,0 150,50 200,0`

## Invert Y

By default, the y == 0 point is in the top of the object. It might be counter-intuitive in some cases so the y coordinates can be inverted with this property. In this case, y == 0 will be the bottom of the object. y invert is disabled by default.
