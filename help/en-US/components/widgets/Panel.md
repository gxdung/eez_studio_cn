# DESCRIPTION

It is used to group several Widgets, and it is used when we want to additionally organize a page that contains a large number of Widgets or if we want to perform some operation on several Widgets at once, e.g. hide using the `Hidden` flag of the Panel. When the Widget is inside the Panel, then its left and top coordinates are relative to the left and top of the Panel, which means that when the Panel is moved, all the Widgets inside it are also moved. Widgets are added to the Panel via the _Widgets Structure_ panel using drag and drop.
